        "The reason for producing this solution is to allow two teams who know different languages and use similar workflows to work collaboratively. In the example model in the video, they wanted to focus on the problem that one part of the same workflow contains different languages and the other part contains different languages. For this, they build a model in Python all within RStudio.\n",

        "RStudio offers three professional tools: Workbench, RStudio Connect, Package Manager. First of all, Workbench provides a workspace for Python scientists to write code in RStudio. RStudio Connect provides the opportunity to share content as the project develops. Allows to deploy a very wide variety of data, data science assets. In Package Manager, you can install packages from here instead of PyPi.\n",
